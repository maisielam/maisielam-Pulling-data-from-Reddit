This is the first portion of a two-part, open-ended team assignment that will culminate in a presentation during the last week of class or the regularly scheduled final exam period. Overall, this term project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with building a complex dataset and making it available. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following:\n",

        "- The construction, acquistion, integration, enrichment, and distribution of a project-motivated and computationally significant dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first report on your team's project will constitue a discussion of what the dataset is that you want to build/access/create, why you believe it will be possilbe to conduct, and how long you believe it will take to build, in addition to discussion of the sorts of tasks that will be involved. Additionally, this inital project planning report should speculate and provide examples potential dataset uses, whether academic or commercial.\n",

        "__Important__: because your project reports will have discussion intermingled with data and code as output, I not only request the  submission of your work in Jupyter Notebooks format, but additionly recommend conducting your work as a group collaboratively in Jupyter notebooks."
